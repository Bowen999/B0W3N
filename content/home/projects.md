### [Metabolyzer](https://sites.google.com/a/georgetown.edu/fornace-lab-informatics/home/metabolyzer)
Metavolyzer is a comprehensive statistical analysis toolset for metabolomics. This software is developed by [Dr. Tytus Mak](https://www.nist.gov/blogs/taking-measure/authors/tytus-mak) at 2014. MetaboLyzerâ€™s workflow is specifically tailored to the unique characteristics and idiosyncrasies of post-processed liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) based metabolomic datasets. I'm currently working with Dr. Mak and [Dr. Evagelia C Laiakis](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014Rj1TAAS/evagelia-laiakis) at [Fornace Lab](https://fornacelab.georgetown.edu/home) to upgrade this software. primarily in the incorporation with the small molecule database and metabolic pathway components.
### [MS-MS Viewer](https://github.com/Bowen999/MS_Viewer) 
MS-MS Viewer is a program written by python that is used to extract and analyze the mass spectrum data in the XML file, and generate a figure including spectrum data and ion peak of the provided peptide sequence, to aid the user in determining whether or not the peptide is a good match to the spectrum.
I developed the command line and GUI two versions.
### [DNA-Protein-Disease Database](https://github.com/Bowen999/Gene_Protein_Disease_Database)
No information.
### [RNAseq Differential Expression Analysis](https://github.com/Bowen999/transcriptome_different_analysis)
Using Galaxy to process RNAseq data, including read quality assessment, trimming, mapping, and feature counting. Using R script for data visualization (e.g., heatmap, PCA), statistical assessment of differential gene expression by using R package edgeR, and gene set enrichment analysis with clusterProfiler. PPI Network was established by using Cytoscape. Finally, the differentially expressed genes and the possible biological meaning were found.
